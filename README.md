### ***NumPy***
> NumPy is a Python library that provides a simple yet powerful data structure: the n-dimensional array. This is the foundation on which almost all the power of Python’s data science toolkit is built, and learning NumPy is the first step on any Python data scientist’s journey.

### ***Matplotlib***
> Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.
matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function changes a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.
